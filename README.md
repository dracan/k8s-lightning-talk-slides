# Kubernetes Lightning Talks Slides

This is the source code for the slides from my Kubernetes Lightning talk that I did at [.NET Oxford](https://www.meetup.com/dotnetoxford).

They have been built using [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/#/), and the `index.html` is the main file with the slide details.

See [here](https://www.danclarke.com/dotnetoxford-june-2018) for the blog post about the lightning talk event.
